# OxyFeeder Master Guide: Complete Development Roadmap

This document outlines the complete development roadmap for the OxyFeeder project, tracking progress from initial app development through final deployment.

## üìä **Overall Project Status: 60% Complete**

---

## **Phase 1: App Development (Software)**
**Goal:** A fully designed, architecturally sound mobile application ready to connect to hardware.  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

### **Sub-Phase 1A: UI/UX Foundation**
**Goal:** Create a visually complete, non-functional app shell.  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

**Detailed Steps:**
1. ‚úÖ **Build Static Dashboard:** Create `dashboard_screen.dart` with `Scaffold` and three `SensorCard` widgets displaying hardcoded placeholder data for DO, Feed Level, and Battery.
2. ‚úÖ **Build Static Settings:** Create `settings_screen.dart` with `Scaffold` and UI elements like sliders and switches, all with hardcoded placeholder values.
3. ‚úÖ **Build Placeholder Sensors:** Create `sensors_screen.dart` with a simple `Scaffold` and a `Center` widget showing "Sensors Screen".
4. ‚úÖ **Implement Navigation:** Create a main navigation host widget (`main_nav_host.dart`) containing a `BottomNavigationBar` to switch between the three screens. Update `main.dart` to use this host as the home.

### **Sub-Phase 1B: Architectural Foundation & State Management**
**Goal:** Make the UI dynamic and ready for data by separating UI from business logic.  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

**Detailed Steps:**
1. ‚úÖ **Create Data Models:** Create `oxyfeeder_status.dart` and `app_settings.dart` in `lib/core/models/` to define the structure of your app's data.
2. ‚úÖ **Add Provider Package:** Run `flutter pub add provider` to add the state management library.
3. ‚úÖ **Create ViewModels:** Create `DashboardViewModel` and `SettingsViewModel` in their respective feature folders. Make them use `ChangeNotifier`.
4. ‚úÖ **Integrate Provider:** In `main.dart`, wrap the `MaterialApp` with a `MultiProvider` that provides both the `DashboardViewModel` and `SettingsViewModel`.
5. ‚úÖ **Refactor UI:** Update the Dashboard and Settings screens to use `Consumer` widgets, connecting their UI elements to the data and methods in their respective ViewModels.

### **Sub-Phase 1C: Final UI and Mock Data Simulation**
**Goal:** Create a fully dynamic, self-contained app that simulates real-world behavior.  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

**Detailed Steps:**
1. ‚úÖ **Add Charting Package:** Run `flutter pub add fl_chart`.
2. ‚úÖ **Build Sensors UI:** In `sensors_screen.dart`, build the detailed UI with a status section and a LineChart using static sample data.
3. ‚úÖ **Create Sensors ViewModel:** Create `SensorsViewModel` and add it to the `MultiProvider`.
4. ‚úÖ **Create Mock Service:** Create `mock_bluetooth_service.dart` in `lib/core/services/`. This class contains a `Timer` that emits a stream of random `OxyFeederStatus` objects.
5. ‚úÖ **Centralize Data Source:** Add the `MockBluetoothService` to the `MultiProvider` (before the ViewModels).
6. ‚úÖ **Refactor ViewModels:** Remove all internal timers from the ViewModels. Instead, make them listen to the stream from the `MockBluetoothService` and update their state based on the data they receive.

## **Phase 2: Core Hardware & Firmware Integration**
**Goal:** Create a functional, stand-alone 'Communication Hub' that broadcasts simulated data over Bluetooth.  
**Status:** üîÑ **IN PROGRESS**

2. ‚úÖ **Redirect Arduino Output:** Modify the scaffold to change all `Serial.print` calls (for the JSON packet) to `Serial1.print`, directing the data to the hardware pins for the ESP32.
3. ‚úÖ **Generate ESP32 Firmware:** Create `firmware/esp32_communicator/esp32_communicator.ino`. This code listens on its `Serial2` port and sets up a complete BLE server to advertise the data it receives.
