## 1. Overview

OxyFeeder is an IoT-based, solar-powered aquaculture management system designed to automate critical fishpond operations. It provides automated, scheduled fish feeding and continuous, real-time monitoring of dissolved oxygen (DO) levels. The system is engineered for sustainability and resilience, making it ideal for small to medium-scale fish farms, particularly in remote or off-grid locations. By leveraging solar power and IoT connectivity, OxyFeeder aims to reduce manual labor, optimize feed usage, prevent fish kills from hypoxia, and promote data-driven, sustainable aquaculture.

## 2. Problem Statement

Traditional aquaculture practices are labor-intensive and prone to inefficiencies that impact profitability and sustainability. Key challenges include:

- **Manual Labor:** Daily manual feeding is time-consuming and inconsistent, leading to scheduling errors.  
- **Feed Waste:** Overfeeding wastes costly resources and contributes to water quality degradation. Underfeeding stunts fish growth.  
- **Hypoxia Risk:** Sudden drops in dissolved oxygen are a primary cause of mass fish kills. Manual spot-checks are often insufficient.  
- **Energy Costs:** Grid-powered systems are expensive and impractical for off-grid farms.  

OxyFeeder directly addresses these issues by providing an automated, self-powered, and intelligent monitoring solution.
