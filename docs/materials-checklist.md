- [ ] I have the Arduino Mega with Female Headers
- [ ] I have the ESP32 with Screw Terminal Extender
- [ ] I have the Logic Level Shifter module
- [ ] I have perfboard, solder, and a soldering iron
- [ ] I have 22 AWG wire in multiple colors

## 💡 Purchasing Notes

### Budget-Friendly Alternatives
- **Perfboard:** Can substitute with prototyping breadboard for initial testing, but solder to perfboard for permanent installation
- **Heat Shrink Tubing:** Electrical tape works in a pinch but is less durable
- **Ferrules:** Can use tinned wire ends instead (less professional but functional)
- **LiFePO4 Battery:** Lead-acid is cheaper upfront; upgrade to LiFePO4 later if budget allows

### Where to Buy
- **Microcontrollers/Sensors:** AliExpress, Amazon, Adafruit, SparkFun, DFRobot
- **Solar/Battery Components:** Specialized solar suppliers, Amazon, local hardware stores
- **Enclosures:** IP-rated boxes from electrical supply stores or Amazon
- **Wire/Connectors:** Electrical supply stores often cheaper than hobby shops for bulk

### Quality Matters
**Don't cheap out on:**
- Voltage sensors (inaccurate readings = unreliable battery monitoring)
- MPPT controller (cheap ones can damage battery or underperform)
- Waterproof enclosure (failure = system death)
- Fuses and fuse holders (safety critical)

**Can be budget-friendly:**
- Perfboard, wire, connectors
- Servo motor
- Prototyping supplies

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Materials Issues

**"My Logic Level Shifter has 8 channels but I only need 4"**
- That's fine! Use 4 channels, leave others unconnected. More channels = more flexibility for future expansion.

**"My ESP32 Extender doesn't have enough screw terminals"**
- You may need to share GND terminals (this is safe - all grounds connect together)
- Consider a separate screw terminal block for additional connections

**"I only have stranded wire, not solid core"**
- For perfboard: Tin the wire ends heavily with solder to make them rigid
- Alternatively: Use male header pins soldered to perfboard, then plug stranded wires in

**"My battery is 18Ah, not 20Ah"**
- Close enough! Anything 15-25Ah works fine. Adjust autonomy calculations accordingly.

**"I have a buck converter but the blueprint says I don't need it"**
- You can use it! Options:
  1. Don't use it (Arduino regulator handles everything)
  2. Use it for servo power if servo draws >500mA
  3. Use it to reduce heat on Arduino regulator (powers ESP32 from buck instead)
