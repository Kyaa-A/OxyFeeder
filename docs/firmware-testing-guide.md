# 🎓 Firmware & Testing Guide - Complete Beginner's Guide

**Purpose:** Step-by-step instructions for uploading firmware and testing your OxyFeeder hardware after Phase 2B assembly.

**When to use this:** After you've built the Communication Hub (Logic Level Shifter bridge connecting Arduino + ESP32)

---

## 📖 Part 1: What is Firmware? (Simple Explanation)

**Think of it like this:**

- **Hardware** = The physical brain (Arduino, ESP32 chips)
- **Firmware** = The instructions that tell the brain what to do
- **Without firmware** = Your Arduino/ESP32 are just expensive paperweights!

**Real-world analogy:**
- Your **microwave** has a chip inside (hardware)
- The chip runs **firmware** that knows: "When user presses 2 minutes, turn on magnetron for 120 seconds"
- Without that firmware, the buttons do nothing

**In your OxyFeeder:**
- Arduino firmware says: "Read sensors every 5 seconds, send data to ESP32"
- ESP32 firmware says: "Take data from Arduino, broadcast it via Bluetooth"

---

## 🔧 Part 2: What Each Firmware Does

### Arduino Firmware (`oxyfeeder_firmware.ino`)

**Job:** The "Brain" - Controls everything

**What it does every loop (every 5 seconds):**
```
1. READ sensors (DO, feed level, battery)
2. PROCESS data (check if feeding time)
3. OUTPUT data as JSON to ESP32 via Serial1
```

**Example output:**
```json
{"do": 7.8, "feed": 62, "battery": 85}
```

**Current state:** Uses fake/simulated data (Phase 2)
**Future state:** Will read real sensors (Phase 5)

---

### ESP32 Firmware (`esp32_communicator.ino`)

**Job:** The "Messenger" - Wireless communication bridge

**What it does:**
```
1. LISTEN to Serial2 for data from Arduino
2. RECEIVE JSON string
3. BROADCAST via Bluetooth to your phone
```

**Think of it as:** A walkie-talkie that translates Arduino's language into Bluetooth signals your phone understands.

## 🧪 Part 4: Testing After Building Hardware (Phase 2C)

### Test Setup

Once you've built the "Bridge" (Logic Level Shifter connecting Arduino + ESP32):

**What you'll have:**
```
Arduino Mega ←→ Logic Level Shifter ←→ ESP32
     ↓                                    ↓
  (USB to PC)                        (USB to PC)
```

---

### 🔬 **Test 1: Individual Components**

You already did this when uploading! Each device works independently.

---

### 🔬 **Test 2: Communication Test (The Important One)**

**Goal:** Verify Arduino can send data to ESP32 through the Logic Level Shifter

#### Setup:
1. **Build your bridge first** (solder Logic Level Shifter to perfboard, connect wires as per master blueprint)
2. **Connect both devices:**
   - Arduino USB to PC
   - ESP32 USB to PC
3. **Both devices powered on** (green LEDs should be lit)

#### Testing Steps:

**A. Open TWO Arduino IDE windows**
- Window 1: For Arduino monitoring
- Window 2: For ESP32 monitoring

**Window 1 (Arduino):**
- Select: **Arduino Mega** board + its COM port
- Open **Serial Monitor** (9600 baud)
- You should see the initialization messages

**Window 2 (ESP32):**
- Select: **ESP32 Dev Module** board + its COM port
- Open **Serial Monitor** (115200 baud)
- You should see BLE initialization

**B. Watch for the magic moment!**

**In ESP32 Serial Monitor, you should see:**
```
Received from Arduino: {"do": 7.8, "feed": 62, "battery": 85}
Data sent to mobile app via BLE
Received from Arduino: {"do": 7.9, "feed": 62, "battery": 86}
Data sent to mobile app via BLE
```

This appears **every 5 seconds** with **changing values**!

**✅ If you see this:** Communication is working! Arduino → Logic Shifter → ESP32 path is good!

**❌ If you DON'T see this:** Jump to [Troubleshooting](#part-5-troubleshooting-common-issues) section below.

## 🐛 Part 5: Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Problem 1: "Port not found" or "Permission denied"

**On Windows:**
- Install CH340 or CP2102 USB drivers
  - Google: "CH340 driver Windows download"
  - Install and restart computer
- Unplug/replug USB cable
- Try a different USB port
- Check Device Manager for yellow exclamation marks

**On Linux/WSL:**
- Add yourself to dialout group:
  ```bash
  sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
  ```
- Restart your computer
- Or try temporary fix:
  ```bash
  sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyUSB0
  ```
  (Replace `/dev/ttyUSB0` with your actual port)

---

### Problem 2: ESP32 "Connecting..." forever

**Solution:**
1. Press and HOLD the "**BOOT**" button on ESP32
2. Click "**Upload**" in Arduino IDE
3. Keep holding BOOT until you see "Writing at 0x00001000..." in output window
4. Release BOOT button
5. Upload should complete normally

**Alternative:**
- Try different USB cable (some are charge-only, not data)
- Try different USB port on computer

---

### Problem 3: ESP32 NOT receiving data from Arduino

**Check this in order:**

**1. Are both devices powered?**
- Look for green power LEDs on both boards
- If no LED: Check USB cable, try different port

**2. Is the Logic Level Shifter connected correctly?**

**Wiring should be:**
```
Arduino Side (HV - High Voltage 5V):
- Arduino 5V      → Shifter HV
- Arduino GND     → Shifter GND
- Arduino Pin 18  → Shifter HV1 (TX1 signal)
- Arduino Pin 19  → Shifter HV2 (RX1 signal)

ESP32 Side (LV - Low Voltage 3.3V):
- Shifter LV      → ESP32 3V3 terminal
- Shifter GND     → ESP32 GND terminal (shared with Arduino GND)
- Shifter LV1     → ESP32 Pin 17 terminal (RX2)
- Shifter LV2     → ESP32 Pin 16 terminal (TX2)
```

**Common mistakes:**
- ❌ Swapping TX and RX
- ❌ Forgetting to connect GND (must be shared!)
- ❌ Connecting HV to 3.3V or LV to 5V (kills the shifter!)

**3. Verify voltages with multimeter (if available):**
- Arduino 5V pin should read ~5V
- ESP32 3V3 terminal should read ~3.3V
- If no multimeter, skip this step

**4. Re-upload both firmwares:**
- Sometimes helps to start fresh
- Upload Arduino firmware again
- Upload ESP32 firmware again

**5. Check Serial Monitor settings:**
- Arduino window: **9600 baud**
- ESP32 window: **115200 baud**
- If wrong baud rate, you'll see garbage characters

---

### Problem 4: Can't find "OxyFeeder" in Bluetooth scan

**Check:**

**1. Is ESP32 running?**
- Look at Serial Monitor (115200 baud)
- Should say "**BLE Server Started - Advertising as 'OxyFeeder'**"
- If not, re-upload firmware

**2. Is Bluetooth enabled on phone?**
- Settings → Bluetooth → **ON**

**3. Is Location enabled? (Android requirement)**
- Settings → Location → **ON**
- Android requires this for BLE scanning (security requirement)

**4. Try restarting ESP32:**
- Unplug USB cable
- Wait 5 seconds
- Plug back in
- Check Serial Monitor to see it restart

**5. Too many devices nearby?**
- Try in a different location (fewer Bluetooth devices)
- Restart nRF Connect app

**6. Clear Bluetooth cache on phone (Android):**
- Settings → Apps → Bluetooth → Storage → Clear Cache

---

### Problem 5: Random/Garbage Data from Arduino

**Check:**
- Baud rate mismatch
- Both Arduino and ESP32 firmware use **9600 baud** for Serial communication
- Verify in code:
  - Arduino: `Serial1.begin(9600);`
  - ESP32: `Serial2.begin(9600, ...);`

---

### Problem 6: Data stops after a while

**Possible causes:**
- Loose wire connection (jiggle wires gently to test)
- Bad solder joint (re-solder if needed)
- USB power saving (disable USB selective suspend in Windows)

**Windows fix for USB power saving:**
1. Control Panel → Power Options
2. Click "Change plan settings" on active plan
3. Click "Change advanced power settings"
4. Expand "USB settings" → "USB selective suspend setting"
5. Set to "**Disabled**"
6. Click Apply
